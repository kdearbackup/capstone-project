# Searchable Enterprise Directory

## Overview

A React web application to allow employees to search an enterprise-wide employee directory. The directory includes:

- Name
- Phone number
- Job role
- Work location
- Salary

Salary is confidential information so:

- Any employee can view their own salary.
- An employee's manager can view the salary of any of their direct reports.
- An employee in the HR role can view anyone's salary.
  Building the Application
- Mongo DB backend data.
- node.js to build a web service to read and write data.
- Build the web application in React.

## Data Analysis

Create a solution that predicts salary based on job role and location.

- Create a script that generates and populates the database with a minimum of 1000 records of dummy data.
- Train a sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression model to predict salary based on job role and location.
- Create a React component that can take job role and location as input and pass that to the model using a RESTful service. Display the returned predicted salary.

TIP: Investigate using the python-shell npm package in Express to call Python from JavaScript. Another option is to use Flask to create the RESTful service.
